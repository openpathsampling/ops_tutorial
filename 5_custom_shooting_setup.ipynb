    "## Changing the shooting move type (e.g., two-way shooting)\n",
    "\n",
    "TPS is usually introduced with two-way shooting. In that algorithm, you select a frame of the trajectory, make some modification (typically changing the velocities in some way consistent with the thermodynamic ensemble), and then integrate the equations of motion forward and backward.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this is problematic if the velocity memory is short compared to your TPS trajectory length, as is often the case in condensed phase systems. In this case, each shot might as well be a committor shot. The ideal place to shoot from is the where the committor is 1/2, where each shot has only a 50% chance of landing in the correct state. But this gives you a maximum of a 25% acceptance rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get around this, we typically use the one-way shooting algorithm when working with condensed matter systems. One-way shooting works under the assumption that you are using a stochastic integrator. If that's the case, then instead of changing the velocities at the shooting point, you can use the fact that the integrator will generate a new sequence of random numbers. Therefore, you create a new trajectory by only running in one direction, and that trajectory is still a valid, physical trajectory.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, OpenPathSampling defaults to using one-way shooting. However, there are circumstances where you might want to use the older two-way shooting algorithm. For example, if the velocity memory is shorter than the period between saved frames, it might be better to use two-way shooting. If you intend to use deterministic dynamics, then one-way shooting is not possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "This part of the tutorial will show you how to use two-way shooting instead of one-way shooting in OPS. There are two ways of doing this: either replace the existing one-way shooting strategy, or create a new move scheme from scratch."
