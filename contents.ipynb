    "Our standard introductory tutorial consists of notebooks 1-3, which deal with solvated alanine dipeptide. One of the main purposes of these notebooks is to illustrate how OpenPathSampling plays a role within a broader ecosystem of scientific software. You will use general scientific Python tools such as `matplotlib` for plotting, and `numpy` or `pandas` for analysis tools. You will also use tools specific to molecular simulation, such as `openmm`, `nglview`, `mdtraj`, and `openmmtools`.\n",
