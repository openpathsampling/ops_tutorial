    "### Plotting the crossing probabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the spot-checks to see if your simulation is converged is to plot the crossing probabilities functions. For each ensemble, the `StandardTISAnalysis` calculates a crossing probability along the order parameter, defined as the fraction of paths in that ensemble that reach at least the given value on the $x$ axis. As such, the crossing probability is always 1 for values less than the cutoff for the interface. Additionally, two ensemble crossing probabilities should never cross; the one from an outer interface should always be higher at a given value of the order parameter than one from an inner interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also the *total* crossing probability, which is generated by using a histogram combining algorithm (usually WHAM) to combine the individual ensemble crossing probabilities into a good estimate for the true crossing probability (from the innermost interface). Like all crossing probabilities, this should be monotonically decreasing; if it is not, that is a sign of insufficient sampling.\n",
