    "# (Embarrassingly) Parallel TIS vs. RETIS: Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "The OPS `DefaultScheme` is designed to provide reasonable default behaviors for TIS. These include replica exchange moves, path reversal moves, the minus interface move, as well as shooting. In general, replica exchange TIS is a more efficient way to sample than TIS without replica exchange. However, replica exchange TIS is much harder to parallelize, because the duration of each trajectory is not known before running the trajectory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, in some cases you may want to sample each interface independently. This allows a na√Øve parallelization, since each interface is its own simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll make move schemes for a custom version of RETIS (similar to the default scheme, but without the minus move) and for running each interface of a TIS simulation independently (in parallel). We'll use the OPS CLI to run it, and in the next notebook we'll compare the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use the same simple toy model as we used in notebooks 5 and 6."
