    "# Committor Analysis Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "As with the TPS analysis tutorial, this is based on results that have already been calculated. This was a simulation of 1000 points selected from a TPS simulation, with 10 committor shots performed on each one -- so a total of 10000 MD simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The committor is closely related to the reaction coordinate: One way to estimate the reaction coordinate is to follow the increasing isocommittors (surfaces with the same value of the committor). The isocommittor with value of 0.5 is particularly interesting: the corresponds to the transition state, where a trajectory started with random velocities has equal probability of ending in reactants or products.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, a full committor analysis is usually very difficult. This one is only partly converged, even with the many, many individual MD simulations included. To reduce the file size, we only saved the first and last snapshot from each committor shot. You can get the file from: https://figshare.com/s/01302bc7a39ec7648ea1\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of this tutorial is focused on how to use [`OpenPathSampling`](http://openpathsampling.org), however, a couple other libraries play an important role:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [`matplotlib`](http://matplotlib.org/), a library for creating plots\n",
    "* [`pandas`](http://pandas.pydata.org/), a library for data analysis\n",
    "* [`nglview`](https://github.com/arose/nglview), which we'll again use to visualize the molecules"
